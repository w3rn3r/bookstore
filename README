I created this maven project with IntelliJ. Dependencies and other libraries were downloaded and compiled with Maven.

Notes on chosen structure: 
According to the instructions this is only an application. It is not specified otherwise to be a Web application.
However, comercially it would hardly make sense to run a bookstore application on one POS only. Assuming that this serves as a prototype, 
ans web application would be the next phase in this project, I used Spring as it would be easier to transform this into a web application.
A web application no doubtedely would require various layers such as: fronntend, backend, services, daos, ejbs, web-services. For this purpose
it will be good to have Spring and Maven to combine so many different components. Spring integrates well with JEE as well and is a commercial
industry standard nowadays. In addition, the current benefit is already a more modular structure and dependency injection which makes
for easy configurability.

Notes on transformation to web application: 
Since this console application is only logically intended for one machine, no regards was given to concurrency of the datastructures like
the inventory, booklist and the operations thereon. However, when converting to a web application the shopping cart for instance would need
to be made sessionscoped. If a SaaS approach is taken BookstoreService can be made an EJB for instance and injected into a service endpoint.
